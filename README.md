#Definition
Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that together laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to said forces. They have been expressed in several different ways over nearly three centuries,[1] and can be summarized as follows:

    First law: When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either is at rest or moves at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.[2][3]
    Second law: The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object and a is the acceleration of the object.
    Third law: When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of the first body.

The three laws of motion were first compiled by Isaac Newton in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687.[4] Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems.[5] For example, in the third volume of the text, Newton showed that these laws of motion, combined with his law of universal gravitation, explained Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

#Application Newton's Law
After its most recent delivery, the infamous stork announces the good news. If the sign has a mass of 10.0 kg, then what is the tensional force in each cable?

Answer: 56.6 N

If the mass of the sign is 10.0 kg, then the weight of the sign is 98 N (Fgrav = m•g). This downward force of gravity must be balanced by the upward component of the tension. Thus, each cable must pull upwards with 49.0 N of force. In addition to the upward pull by the cable, there is also a horizontal pull. The tension force is the combined effect of these two componens. To determine the tension, set up a 60-30-90 triangle with a vertical component of 4.09 N as shown at the right. Then, use the sine function to solve for the hypotenuse of the triangle. The work is shown below:
sin(60 deg.) = 49.0 N/Ftens

Ftens = (49.0 N)/(sin 60 deg) = 56.6 N
